As part of a high school project in 2021, I made a bird feeder that takes pictures of birds as they land to feed. Before I did this project, I felt very comfortable with Onshape and 3D printing, but I didn't know much about the electrical and computer science side of things. This project introduced me to using python and soldering in a real-world setting. While the entire project was really simple, it gave a good general sense of what doing electrical and CS stuff for a project is like... plus the results were really cool!

These are some pictures taken from the device:
