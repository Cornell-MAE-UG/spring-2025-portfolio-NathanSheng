For an introduction to mechanical design class I took in spring 2025, we were asked to make a mechanical device over the course of the semester. What my group made was a device that can be attached to a mini basketball hoop which launches the ball back to the user after they make the shot.  

I got more practice with Fusion 360 and designing laser cut parts from this project. 

This is the acrylic frame and laser cut wood ramp I designed:
